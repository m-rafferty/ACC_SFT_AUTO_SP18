<Lab>
Follow along as I create a data driven test for blaze demo:
Create data file 
(pay attention to what you name the variables in your header)
Create and save case
Add two variables (variables tab)
(Remember to name the variables exactly what you have in the header of the data file)
Change input types to variables (manual tab) 
Add Data file to Katalon (right click data file > new > data file)
Create suite
Add case
Show data bindings
Add your test Data
Map/Bind variables
Run 

Review this code:
#print all the city combo pairs
departure_cities = ["Paris","Philadelphia","Boston","Portland","San Diego","Mexico City","São Paolo"]
destinations = ["Buenos Aires","Rome","London","Berlin","New York","Dublin","Cairo"]

for city in departure_cities:
    for destination in destinations:
        print city + "," + destination

Open IDLE.
Create a new file
Copy and paste the script from above
Save and Run the script
Note when you attempt to save this script you may receive an I/O warning.  Press ok to proceed.
(what causes the I/O warning?)
Look at the output

Building test automation for Blaze Demo site.
We are going to automate the testing of www.blazedemo.com

From last week complete the exercise to build a data driven test for all flight combos
1. Open blaze demo website www.blazedemo.com
2. Build a data driven test to test all flights to all cities
Hint: use the output from the python script above and save it as a csv
