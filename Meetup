CD-WiT (Capital District Women in Technology) is conducting a meetup on 20th June, where the topic is to know the job market and open positions in and around capital district. I think this will be very beneficial for the students who are attending the automated testing course and will be looking for jobs.

Students will also get a 1:1 review of their resume' and probable match of jobs for their skill-set.

Please let the students know about this event: https://www.meetup.com/CD-WiT/events/250792969/

You will need to RSVP to the event if you are attending.
